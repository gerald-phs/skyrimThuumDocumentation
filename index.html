  <p>Dragons are ancient creatures. Very intelligent, they devised a language of their own. Ever since being a small dragonling, the <i>Voice</i> is already in their bones. It is a very terse dialect, composed of monossilabic words, raw in their pronounciation: almost like encantations. I have never met a man who has mastered the Voice, and I still believe none but the High Monks can. I once thought about climbing the thousand steps, but I did not, and never will. Leave the pride to the doer of deeds, and the doer of works. I write stuff down, and nothing more. However, if you wish to know more about Draconic, read on.</p>

  <p>Orange is the second color, and there is a fruit that is also called orange. It’s a pretty great color.</p>
  <h1 id="yellow">Yellow</h1>
  <p>This color right here is pretty much sacred. It is the Great Yolk of the Five Gates of the West: in the very midst of conflict, the Egg stood, unscathed, as the swords clashed, man against man in the horrible reign of disorder, Satan’s wings spread wide. After the bloodshed, the Mighty Egg was found, and behold, it was whole and golden (<b>and golden</b>, I said) — this I witnessed with mine own two eyes. Yellow yolk, yellow sun, yellow soul.
  <h1 id="green">Green</h1>
  <p>I love vegetables. Vegetables are most important. Although skeptics might disagree, by using their own method one can find this out for oneself: plants that are cared for grow taller and stronger than their... <i>peers</i>, I reckon.</p>
  <h1 id="cyan">Cyan</h1>
  <p>The bright, cloudless, summer sky.</p>
  <h1 id="blue">Blue</h1>
  <p>The blue, sticky dust from <i>indigo</i> pigment used for the fabrication of paints.</p>
  <h1 id="violet">Violet</h1>

  <p>Here we are, at the end of the visible spectrum, sad and curious. One is left to wonder <i>what comes next?</i> No human being, dead or alive on the face of this Earth has ever seen <abbr title="Ultraviolet">UV</abbr> radiation because the rods and cones present in the eye can only process photons, and nothing more. <i>The Unseen World</i> — this itself is philosophy. Anyways, violet it is. <i>Right-o, good job gentlemen! Wrap it up, and let’s go home. Cave Johnson, we’re done here.</i>
